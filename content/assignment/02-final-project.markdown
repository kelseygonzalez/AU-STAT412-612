# Progress Report Requirements
Submit an approximately two-page report on the group's progress to date. Topics should include: 

- Title of the project
- Names of the group members and their course (412 or 612) 
- General discussion of the topic area
- Status of the literature review and the initial sources. 
    -These don't all need to be academic, they should make sense for your topic and outline what has been done in this area and help inform your questions of interest. 
- Initial Questions of Interest
- Data source and status of data collection and tidying
- Planned next steps and schedule or timeline for what you will have done and when
- Planned roles for group members
- Any concerns or major challenges
