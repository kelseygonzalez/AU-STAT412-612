# Baltimore City Crime Data:
1. Download the Baltimore City Crime dataset: [<i class="fas fa-file-csv"></i> `baltimore_crime.csv`](/data/baltimore_crime.csv). This data was originally available at [this URL](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Part-1-Victim-Based-Crime-Data/wsfq-mvij), but it has since been moved. Use a readr function to load the data.


2. Review the data and fix variable types. 
    - Make sure you convert `CrimeCode`, `Description`, `Inside/Outside`, `Weapon`, and  `District` each to factors, 
        - You can change col_types in your `read_csv()` function and / or using `mutate()`.
    - Parse `CrimeDate` and `CrimeTime` into date and time (_or period_) objects using `lubridate` functions.
    - hint: There will be parse failure dialogue if you didn't declare `quiet = TRUE`. That's okay. 



3. Fix non-standard variable names
    - Use a "_" to replace the "/" or " " in the three non-standard variable names
    - Show the new names of the dataframe columns



4. Fix duplicate rows
    - Are there any duplicate rows? 
    - Remove them from the current data frame


5. Fix different codings for variables
    - Find the unique levels for Inside_Outside.
        - It appears there are two different coding systems in place. 
    - Use a `forcats` function to update the data frame to use a single coding system with the values Inside, Outside, and `NA`.
    - hint: there is more than one option here, but it may help to think about _renaming_ or _collapsing_ the levels



6. Find the hour of each crime
    - From the `CrimeDateTime` variable, create a new variable called `CrimeHour` with the extracted hour that the crime occurred. 



7. Reproduce the following plot. (hint: `geom_histogram()`)
    - By looking at it, which hour of the day has the most inside crime and which has the most outside crime.
    - Think about how data might get entered and speculate on the cause for the mid-day spike

8. Reorder the `Description` variable by total frequency of occurrence. Create a presentation-ready plot that shows the Description on one axis and the count of occurrences on the other axis. 



9. Which days of the week has the most homicides in Baltimore? list all 7 labeled days in descending order by count.
